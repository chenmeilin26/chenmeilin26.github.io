        This is a page where I put some interesting things in my life. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I was born in Chengdu, China. In spare time, I particularly like to dance (Choreography, Hip-Hop and K-pop). I used to taking highly intensive training dancing classes at SINOSTAGE between 2020 and 2021. And I was one of the leaders of my undergraduate street dance club in 2021.

        I also liked reading a lot. My favourate books are Hongloumeng (by Cao Xueqin) and The Three-body Problem (by Liu Cixin). They're both Chinese fiction. If you want to recommend some books for me, feel free to contact me!
